#### "The best for your pets... naturally."

#### Description

We are a locally owned, small business that carries natural, healthy, and holistic options for your pets. We pride ourselves on our knowledgeable staff who is always willing to listen and help you with whatever you and your pet need. As a small business, our space is limited, but we are always happy to special order any product we can that we don't stock on the shelves.
We believe that nutrition is key to the health of animals and dedicate a large part of our store to a wide variety of corn, wheat, soy, and by-product free foods (Including dry, canned, freeze dried, and raw diets). In addition we have lots of treats, chews and toys for dogs and cats, as well as all the necessary supplies like collars, leashes, beds, crates, kitty litter, and scratch posts.
We try to stock a variety of products and supplements for the health of your animals as well. We have everything from dental chews, to brushes, digestive aids and natural remedies for things like anxiety, itchy skin and joint support. So whether your pet just needs a new toy, some treats, a bath, cleaner teeth, or a solution to any on going problem, we're here to help.
Of course a pet store can't be entirely without pets, so we regularly have cats and kittens up for adoption, as well as some small fish, and the occasional small animal looking for a home. Finally, we have basic supplies for the fish, reptile, bird, or small animal in your life too!
